      "70 \n \nTHE CANDLESTICK TRADING BIBLE \nTime frames and top down analysis \nAs a price action trader, your primary time frame is the 1H, the 4H and \nthe daily. \n Price action works on bigger time frames, if you try to trade pin bars \nor engulfing bars on the 5-minute time frame, you will lose your \nmoney, because there is lot of noise on smaller time frames, and the \nmarket will generate lot of false signals because of the hard battle \nbetween the bears and bulls. \nBesides, there is no successful price action trader who focuses on one-\ntime frame to analyze his charts, maybe you have heard of the term \ntop and down analysis which means to begin with bigger time frames \nto get the big picture, and then you switch to the smaller one to decide \nwhether to buy or to sell the market. \nLet’s say you want to trade the 4h chart, you have to look at the weekly \nchart first, and then the daily chart, if the weekly and the daily charts \nanalysis align with the 4h chart, you can then take your trading \ndecision.  \nAnd if you want to trade the 1H chart, you have to look at the daily \nchart first. This is a critical step to do as a price action trader, because \nthis will help you avoid low probability trading setups, and it will allow \nyou to stay focused on high probability price action signals. \nThrough our top down analysis, we always start with the bigger time \nframe, and we look for to gather the following information: \n-The most important support and resistance levels: these areas \nrepresent turning points in the market, if you can identify them on the \nweekly chart, you will know what is going to happen when the price \napproaches these levels on the 4h chart.  \nSo you will decide either to buy, to sell or to ignore the signals you get \nfrom the market.",

      "126 \n \nTHE CANDLESTICK TRADING BIBLE \nLet me give you an example, when you are driving your car, you don’t \nalways drive the same way, if you are driving downtown, you try to \ndrive slowly, because you know that driving fast can put your life or \nother’s life in danger \nBut when you are driving in a highway, you’re driving style changes \ncompletely, because you know that you can drive fast. So, you always \ntry to adapt your driving style to the appropriate situation. \nYou have to do the same thing when you are trading the engulfing bar \npattern, because all price action strategies we discussed before will \nnot work in range bound markets, and you have to use the right \ntechniques that fit these market conditions. \nBefore talking about the right way to trade trendless markets, you \nhave to be selective about trading range bound markets to protect \nyour trading account, because not all sideways markets are worth \ntrading. You have to know how to differentiate between sideways and \nchoppy markets.   \nSee the illustration below about choppy markets:",
