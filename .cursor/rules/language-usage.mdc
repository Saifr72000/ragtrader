title: No Emojis Policy (Frontend + Backend)

scope:
  - All generated code, comments, logs, prompts, test names, commit messages, and UI copy.

rules:
  - Do not output or include emojis or decorative symbols.
  - Use plain, professional text with clear tags instead (e.g., [INFO], [ERROR], [WARN]).
  - Avoid Unicode glyphs that act as emoji substitutes.

rationale:
  - Improves readability, searchability, accessibility, and consistency across environments.

examples:
  - Bad:
    - console.log("App started");
    - console.error("Operation failed");
    - // Temporary: feature flag enabled
    - return "New trade placed at price";
  - Good:
    - console.log("[STARTUP] App started");
    - console.error("[ERROR] Operation failed");
    - // Temporary: feature flag enabled
    - return "New trade placed at price";

enforcement:
  - If a prior file includes emojis, remove them in subsequent edits.
  - Prefer structured prefixes: [STARTUP], [INFO], [WARN], [ERROR], [DEBUG].
